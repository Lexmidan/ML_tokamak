## Types of ELMS

* Type I ELMs. the ELM repetition frequency νELM increases with heating power. There is
no detectable magnetic precursor oscillation. However, the level of broadband magnetic
and density turbulent fluctuations increases prior to a type I ELM. Ideal ballooning
analysis shows that the plasma edge is always close to the stability limit α ≈ αcrit [7].
Type I ELMs appear as isolated sharp bursts on the Dα-signal.
* Type II ELMs. If, in a DIII-D discharge exhibiting type I ELMs, the shape of the plasma
cross section is changed towards higher elongation and triangularity, the appearance of
the ELMs may change: they become more frequent and the magnitude of the Dα-burst
decreases. In this case, the plasma edge is found to be in the connection regime between
the first and the second stable region of the ballooning diagram [8]. For type II ELMs,
no information on the power dependence of νELM or the MHD precursor activity exists.
* Type III ELMs. The ELM repetition frequency decreases with heating power. A coherent
magnetic precursor oscillation of frequency νprec ≈ 50–70 kHz is observed on magnetic
probes located close to the plasma in the outboard midplane. A toroidal mode number
of n ≈ 5–10 was inferred. The plasma edge pressure gradient is significantly below the
ideal ballooning limit, i.e. 0.3 6 α/αcrit 6 0.5 [9].
